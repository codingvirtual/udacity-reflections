When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repositories will help with multiple issues:
		a)	Multiple collaborators working on a single project. The repo serves as a
			collection point for the combined file set.
		b)	Backups - by setting up a remote, it's easy to push the commits up to the
			remote, which serve as a backup if something happened to the local machine.
		c)	Sharing - github makes it easy to share a project with others either for
			viewing or for collaborative editing
		d)	Code retrieval - remote repos are easy to clone and pull down to your local
			machine so you can see the code someone else wrote, alter it and compile your
			own version, or just run it.
